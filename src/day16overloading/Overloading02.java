		// java understands whether a method is different from names and parameters.
		// Method name and parameters are like signature of methods for java.
		// After now  we will use "methods signature".
		
		// Note 2: Changing Access modifier does not make methods different in terms of java. 
		// because the access modifier is not including the method signature
		
		// Note3: Changing the body of the methods does not change the methods in terms of java 
		// because bodies is not included in the method signature.
		
		// Note4: If java warns you before you run the code, these errors are called "compile time error".
		
		// Note 5: There is no error while writing the code but if you get red error messages 
		// in console after running the code, these errors are called "Run time Error"
		
		// Note 6: Returns overloading compile time error.
